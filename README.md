Hello,

Project Overview

For our Project 2 submission, we have cleaned and updated excel files and saved  files as csv.
From there we have provided syntax to have the files imported to sql format to reflect in pgadmin in table form.

Pre-requisites
Python libraries required are pandas, sqlalchemy, json, numpy. For the schemata please use pgAdmin to view the tables.

How to run the Project
To run the notebook smoothly, please open the folder to your vs code and from there, run the notebook for each respsective part. Resources folder contains the xlsx format files as well as the saved csv files.

Project pipleine
Excel format files read through jupyter notebook, and then to pandas Dataframe. From there modified based off the project requirements and saved as csv. Cvs's then imported into pgadmin to have reflect in schemata/tables.
